NOTICE:

"Quota support has only been tested on ext4 and Linux 3.18 or higher. If enabling on other filesystems, or on older kernel versions, device manufacturers are responsible for testing and vetting for statistics correctness."

You can read more here: https://source.android.com/devices/storage/faster-stats. As a side note, i didn't had any problem with quota on f2fs until now.
